Hello PLP Team!!!
 My name is Sodeeq Opeyemi Bello from Nigeria. I am using this opportunity to say a big THANK YOU to Power Learning Project for this exciting opportunity. I am excited to be a part of this community and I look forward to learning from all of you and sharing my knowledge with you as well.
About Me.
 I'm an aspiring software developer and data analyst with a solid background in Physics and Electronics, aiming to apply this knowledge in the healthcare sector, specifically in medical physics, such as medical imaging, diagnostics, and AI in medicine. Currently participating in the Power Learn Project's Software Development Scholarship, where I am gaining practical experience in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Database Management. I am enthusiastic about leveraging digital tools to address real-world challenges and foster innovation in underprivileged communities. I look forward to applying my technical and analytical skills in a dynamic internship setting.
